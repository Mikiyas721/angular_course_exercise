- A project that shows images in a paginated manner.
- The following angular concepts are covered:
   1. [ngClass]="{active:condition1===condition2}"
   2. Don't add HTML element to account for addition of multiple structural directives
      Intead use <ng-container></ng-container>
   3. [ngSwitch]=""
      *ngSwitchCase=""
	  *ngSwitchDefault
   4. Create custom directives using "ng generate directive <directivename>"
   5. Use the '@Input()' decorator along with a setter to allow for property binding
   6. We can use Input Aliasing to avoid using a separate call to the directive and property binding.
   7. ElementRef used in attribute directive
   8. "TemplateRef", "ViewContainerRef" used in structural directive   
- This project uses bootstrap styling Framework
