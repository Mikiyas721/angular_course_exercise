Module 20

- Custom validators can be implemented as a class or as a function.
- When implementing custom validators as a class, implement an interface(Validator or AsyncValidator).
- When implementing a custom validator as a function, the validator function has the same signature as the 
  "validate" method that is implemented in the class based custom validator.
- If we want to pass parameters to the validator, when we assign it, We can make a function that
  accepts the functions and returns the validator function.
- "delay" operator to delay emission of items from the source Observable.
- Accessing FormGroups from custom directives ...
